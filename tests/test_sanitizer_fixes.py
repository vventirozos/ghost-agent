def test_repair_line_trailing_backslash_three():
    # Case: "print('hi') \\\\" -> 3 backslashes. It's an escaped backslash AND a trailing one?
    # No, usually means "Text \\" which is escaped slash + dangling slash.
    # The logic says: if odd, strip cleanly.
    # "abc\\\" -> "abc" (strip the last backslash logic might be complex here)
    # The code implementation: line[:match.start()] + line[match.start():].replace('\\', '').rstrip()
    # Wait, the code I wrote:
    # line[:match.start()] + line[match.start():].replace('\\', '').rstrip()
    # If match is "\\\\\\" (3 slashes)
    # It replaces ALL slashes in that group with empty string.
    # So "abc\\\" becomes "abc". 
    # IS THIS CORRECT? 
    # If I have "print('\\')" -> the line ends with "\')". No trailing backslash at EOL.
    # If I have "print('\\') \\" -> ends with " \\". match is "\\". 1 slash.
    # If I have "x = \\\" -> ends with 3 slashes. match is "\\\".
    # If I strip ALL slashes, I get "x = ". 
    # Is that what we want? "x = \\" would be a valid escaped backslash if inside string?
    # But this is EOL. "x = \\" is SyntaxError. "x = \\\" is SyntaxError.
    # Code: "x = 1" -> Valid.
    # Code: "x = 1 \\" -> SyntaxError (unexpected char after line continuation)
    # Code: "x = 1 \\\\" -> SyntaxError (unexpected char after line continuation?? No, \\ is line continuation?)
    # Wait. In Python:
    # x = 1 \
    # y = 2  <- valid line continuation
    # But if it's the LAST char of the file/block and no newline follows?
    # The sanitizer runs line-by-line using `_repair_line`.
    # `ast.parse` will fail if a line ends in `\` and is not followed by continuation.
    # So stripping `\` at EOL is generally good for "User accidentally pasted a line continuation".
    
    # What if it's inside a string?
    # "print(' \\ ')" -> The line ends with " ')" -> valid.
    # "print(' \\ ')" matches `(\\+)\s*$` ? No.
    # "print(' \\ ')" does NOT end with backslash.
    # "x = 1 \\" -> Ends with backslash.
    
    # Back to "x = \\\\" (2 slashes).
    # Regex `(\\+)\s*$` matches `\\\\`. Group 1 is `\\\\`. Len is 2. Even.
    # Code: `if num_slashes % 2 != 0:` -> False. We DO NOT strip.
    # So "x = \\\\" remains "x = \\\\".
    # In Python, `\` is line continuation. `\\` is NOT valid at EOL unless inside a comment or string?
    # `x = 1 \\` -> SyntaxError: unexpected character after line continuation
    # `x = 1` -> Valid.
    # So actually, `\\` at EOL outside a string is ALSO invalid python usually?
    # Unless it's a comment `x = 1 # path\to\stuff`. 
    # But wait, `_repair_line` is aggressive.
    
    # My implementation:
    # if num_slashes % 2 != 0: ...
    # So it strictly targets "odd" slashes.
